# Gargantua MVP - Setup Complete ✅

## Overview

Gargantua is a private personal finance tracker built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Supabase. This MVP document summarizes the completed infrastructure and next steps for feature development.

**Deployed at**: `gargantua.viraj.app`

- ✅ Project structure created (app, components, lib, types, docs)
- ✅ Build verification passed

### 2. Authentication & Authorization

- ✅ Supabase client configuration (client-side & server-side)
- ✅ Login page with Google OAuth
- ✅ Unauthorized page for access denied scenarios
- ✅ OAuth callback route (`/api/auth/callback`)
- ✅ Middleware for authentication and authorization

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### Multi-Subdomain Strategy

**Problem**: Supabase free tier limits make it impractical to have one project per subdomain.

**Solution**: Use PostgreSQL schemas to isolate data by subdomain within a single Supabase project.

```
Shared Supabase Project (viraj.app)
├── public schema (shared)
│   ├── profiles (all users)
│   └── project_access (authorization registry)
├── gargantua schema (gargantua.viraj.app)
│   ├── transactions (unified income & expenses with type field)
│   ├── wishlist
│   └── user_settings
├── blog schema (future: blog.viraj.app)
│   ├── posts
│   ├── comments
│   └── ...
└── portfolio schema (future: portfolio.viraj.app)
    └── ...
```

### Benefits

- ✅ Cost efficient (single Supabase project)
- ✅ Data isolation per subdomain
- ✅ Shared authentication across subdomains
- ✅ Centralized user management
- ✅ Easy to add new subdomains

## 🔐 Authentication Flow

1. **User clicks "Continue with Google"**
2. **Google OAuth flow** authenticates the user
3. **Supabase creates user** in `auth.users`
4. **Trigger auto-creates profile** in `public.profiles`
5. **Admin grants access**:
   ```sql
   SELECT public.grant_project_access('user-id'::uuid, 'gargantua', 'admin');
   ```
6. **Middleware validates**:
   - User is authenticated
   - User has `is_authorized = true` in `project_access` for 'gargantua'
   - User matches `NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTHORIZED_EMAIL` or `NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTHORIZED_USER_ID`
7. **RLS policies enforce** data access at database level

---

## 🗄️ Database Schema

### Shared Tables (public schema)

**public.profiles**

- Shared user profiles across all viraj.app subdomains
- Auto-created on signup

**public.project_access**

- Controls which users can access which projects/subdomains
- Required for authorization

### Gargantua Tables (gargantua schema)

**gargantua.transactions**

```sql
id, user_id, type (income/expense), amount, date, category, description,
source (for income), payment_method (for expenses), is_recurring (for expenses),
created_at, updated_at
```

**Architecture Note**: The transactions table uses a unified structure with a `type` field to distinguish between income and expense entries. This simplifies queries, real-time subscriptions, and data management while maintaining all required fields for both transaction types.

**gargantua.wishlist**

```sql
id, user_id, item_name, cost, priority (1-3), necessity (1-5), is_purchased, created_at, updated_at
```

**gargantua.user_settings**

```sql
id, user_id, currency, date_format, theme, created_at, updated_at
```
